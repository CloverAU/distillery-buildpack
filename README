# Distillery buildpack

This buildpack is for use in conjuction with the elixir buildpack, but for an app that has been configured to use distillery.

## Why?

We needed to migrate an app already configured to use distillery and wanted to make as few changes to it as possible

## How?

All it does is runs `mix release`, you will need to modify your Procfile to run the built release

Example procfile

```
web: _build/prod/rel/appname/bin/trading foreground
```
